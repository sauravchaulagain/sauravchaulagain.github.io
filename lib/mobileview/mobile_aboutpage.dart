            "I'm Saurav Chaulagain. I am passionate about Mobile application development (Flutter).  I'm constantly striving to learn new things and improve. I follow industry news; regularly tinker with new technologies, and read books and blogs to keep my skills current. I am currently studying Bachelor in Information Technology. I also have significant experience in UX/UI designing Mobile Applications. I have the ability to operate well both independently and in a team setting. I can stay on task and meet deadlines even when under pressure. \n\nI approach all my projects, regardless of the project size, with a kick-off discovery session to understand my client’s vision, the business objectives and what the user data is indicating. I’ve trained myself to make a quick usability test the moment I open a new website or an app, so this comes almost for free during our first meeting.",
